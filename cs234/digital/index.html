            <p>
            The purpose of this project was to gain insight into the behavior of <b>'Digital Natives'</b>, broadly defined
            as the generation of people raised in the age of digital technology/the Internet Age. Specifically,
            this report focuses on investigating the use of direct messaging by digital natives, and potential
            variations in the use of direct messaging across platforms. <b>Direct messaging</b>, defined here as
            the exchange of messages between individuals or groups of individuals (as opposed to wider-reaching
            content such as posts on social media), constitutes a large portion of the digital interactions in which
            digital natives participate. To gauge the importance of direct messaging in the small population
            from which I gathered data for this project (friends of mine, all college-aged women), I surveyed a few people
            (5 respondents) on their direct messaging behavior. 80% of those surveyed reported that they use direct
            messaging as their primary form of digital communication. I also asked survey respondents to rank the top 3
            media platforms which they believe they use most for direct messaging. The results (shown below) indicate
            that <b>Texts/iMessage, Facebook Messenger</b>, and <b>Email</b> are the most commonly used direct
            messaging platforms. These platforms (+ twitter) were thus chosen as the sources investigated in this
            project.

			<h4 >Questions and Hypotheses </h4>
			<p>To systematically evaluate the use of direct messaging by digital natives across platforms, I looked
			at both metadata traces(e.g number of messages, timing of messages, etc.) as well as message content. Specifically,
			I focused on the following questions: </p>
			<ul>
          	<li><b>What platforms do digital natives use most for messaging?</b></li>
          	<ul>
          	<li>Total number of messages exchanged</li>
          	<li>Percent of messages sent and received</li>
          	<li>Number of messages exchanged per day</li>
          	<li>Number of conversations </li>
          	<li> Number of messages per conversation</li>
          	</ul>
          	<li><b>How do the social network structures differ between platforms? Are they tight-knit groups
          	or more diverse? Are they mainly individual messages or group messages?</b> </li>
          	<ul>
          	<li>Number of unique people messaged</li>
          	<li>Number of people per conversation (e.g. group chats, email chains) </li>
          	</ul>
          	<li><b>When do digital natives do this messaging? Does this vary by platform?</b></li>
          	<ul>
          	<li>Messaging behavior by month</li>
          	<li>Messaging behavior by time of day</li>
          	<li>Messaging behavior by day of the week </li>
          	</ul>
          	<li><b>What does the content of these messages look like? How does message content vary across platforms</b></li>
          	<ul>
          	<li>Number of words per message</li>
          	<li>Average word length</li>
          	<li>Use of emojis</li>
          	<li>Topic modelling</li>
          	<li>Most frequent words</li>
          	</ul>
          	</ul>
			<p>I hypothesized based on personal experience, and from discussions with friends, that texting/
			iMessage would be the most-used direct messaging platform, followed by facebook messenger (in
			accordance with preliminary survey responses). Email is often viewed as a more professionally-
			oriented platform (used for academic matters), while platforms like iMessage are mainly for
			personal use. Therefore, I hypothesized that Email messages would be exchanged across a wider
			range of distinct users, be less frequent, consist of smaller conversations, and generally be
			longer. On the other hand, I hypothesized that iMessages would be exchanged across a smaller
			group of close friends, with long conversations made up of short messages. </p>

            <h2 class="section-heading" id="data">Data Collection </h2>

            <p>I was able to collect the direct messages of two 'digital natives' (both college-aged women). From
            person 1, I collected Email data, Facebook Messenger data, and text messages. From person 2, I collected
            Email data, Facebook Messenger data, and twitter messages. Because overall messaging behavior is likely to
            differ between individuals, and because of the small sample size, all analyses are separated by user (referred
            to as User 1 or User 2). Data was collected through a combination of direct data archive
            downloads from the media sources and text parsing. The data collection process is documented in the notebooks linked below for
            email, facebook, iMessage, and twitter data. To evaluate messaging behavior over a distinct time
            period, all analyses were limited to messages from 2017 (all users and platforms had messages extending back
            farther than 2017). Because of the different organization of these four platforms, certain features
            (such as what constitues a conversation) were defined differently between platforms:
            <ul>
            <li><b>Facebook: </b>For facebook, all messages sent through Facebook Messenger were considered to be direct
            messages (including group messages). A conversation was defined as the set of all messages between
            two individuals or a group of individuals. An archive of facebook messenger data was downloaded
            from facebook.com, and processed as described in <a href="Facebook_Data_Collection.html">this notebook</a> </li>
            <li><b>Email: </b>For email, all messages were downloaded from GMail using <a href= "https://takeout.google.com/settings/takeout?pli=1
            ">Takeout</a> and processed as described<a href="Email_Data_Collection.html"> here </a>.
            A conversation was defined as all messages sent on a given chain(replies to some original
            message). </li>
            <li><b>iMessage: </b>iMessage data was downloaded from an iPhone using iTunes, extracted using iExplorer, and processed
            as described<a href="iMessage_Data_Collection.html"> here </a>. A conversation as defined as the set of all messages between individuals or
            groups of individuals.</li>
            <li><b>Twitter: </b>An archive of twitter data was downloaded from twitter.com and processed as described<a href="Twitter_Data_Collection.html"> here </a>.
            Only messages in reply to another use's message (those starting with the @ handle) were considered
            to be direct messages. A conversation was defined as the set of all messages in response to the
            original message.</li>
            </ul>
             </p>


            <h2 class="section-heading" id="metadata">Direct Messaging Across Platforms: Metadata Analysis </h2>

            <p>The data gathered was first explored in terms of overall messaging behavior. The
            data traces were evaluated based on feature such as the total number of messages, the
            number of users messaged, and the timing of these messages.</p>
            <h4 >Most Used Direct Messaging Platforms </h4>
            <p><b>Total Number of Messages: </b>First evaluated was the total number of messages exchanged through each platform.
            For user 1, the greatest number of messages were exchanged via iMessage/texts, in
            accordance with the survey results, followed by email and facebook messenger. For user 2,
            the greatest number of messages were exchanged via twitter, followed by email and facebook.
            The finding that fewer messages were exchanged via facebook messenger than via email for
            both users was
            unexpected given the results of the initial survey. One possible explanation is that the majority
            of these email messages were not necessarily conversations, but rather emails that were
            sent to an entire email list (e.g. schoolwide emails). In fact, this seems to be the case. When
            the messages were analyzed in terms of the percentage of total messages sent by the user, messages
            sent via email comprised only 5-10% of total messages, while those sent via facebook messenger
            and texts constituted upwards of 20%.
			<img src="images/num_messages.png" width="700" alt="Number of Messages">
            <img src="images/messages_sent.png" width="700" alt="Percent of Messages Sent">
            <b>Average Number of Messages per Day: </b> The number of messages exchanged per platform was quantified as the average number of
            messages sent per platform per day. This analysis reveals that User 1 is generally a more
            active direct messenger, exchanging between 8 and 24 messages on average per day, compared
            with User 2, who exchanges only between 6 and 9 messages per day.
            <img src="images/per_day.png" width="700" alt="Number of Messages Per Day">
            <b>Number and Length of Conversations: </b>The total number of conversations exchanged by platform (where a conversation is defined
            as described above) was analyzed for each user. For User 1, a far greater number of conversations
            were exchanged via email than either facebook messenger or iMessage. For User 2, most
            conversations were exchanged via twitter, followed by email. This dramatic difference
            between the number of conversations exchanged per platform, especially for User 1 can be
            explained by the different nature of conversations on these different platforms. Facbook and
            iMessage conversations are generally fewer but longer, as shown below, while email conversations
            are more likely to be short exchanges of information accomplished in only a few messages.
            <img src="images/num_convos.png" width="700" alt="Number of Conversations">
            <img src="images/convo_length.png" width="700" alt="Conversation Length">
            <b>Number of Unique Users Messaged: </b>To gain further insight into the different ways in which
            these platforms are used, I next looked at the number of unique users messaged.  This analysis revealed that for
            both users, messages were exchanged between a greater number of distinct individuals via email
            than via facebook messenger (user 2 exchanged messages with an equally large group of distinct
            users via twitter). This result confirms the suggestion above that email is likely being used
            primarily for exchanges of a more professional nature, involving a wide range of individuals (i.e
            a school community), while facebook messages are used for more private exchanges between smaller
            groups of close friends.
			<img src="images/unique_users.png" width="700" alt="Unique Users">
			<p><b>Number of People per Conversation: </b>I also decided to explore the average number of people per conversation to
			investigate whether certain media platforms were being used primarily for group
			messages vs. individual messages. This analysis shows that for both users, the mean
			number of people per conversation is greatest for facebook messenger. This
			finding confirms personal experience that I have had using facebook messenger to
			coordinate group projects and events amongst larger groups of people.
			Text messages also seem to be used extensively by User 1 for group messaging, with an
			average of 1.83 people (besides the user) per conversation. For both users,
			email conversations contain the fewest number of people on average, again in
			line with the emerging picture of email as a medium for short exchanges rather than
			lengthy conversations. (*Note, for this analysis, the number of people in a conversation was
			defined as the number of other users actively contributing messages, rather than
			simply users to which a group message was sent). Because I had access only to
			User 2's own twitter messages(not exchanges between other users), such a conversation
			analysis could not be performed for User 2's twitter data. </p>
			<img src="images/people_per_convo.png" width="700" alt="People per Conversation">

			<h4>Timing of Direct Messaging Across Platforms </h4>
			<p>I next set out to evaluate whether the timing of message exchange varied based on the four
			platforms explored (on a monthly, daily, and hourly basis). Based on the result described above,
			 it seems that the different platforms are being used rather differently (emails for shorter
			conversations between a more varied group of people, facebook messages/texts for
			longer conversations between a smaller number of people). I hypothesized that
			if in fact emails are being used mainly for academic/professional exchanges, the number
			of emails would be greatest during the middle of the day ('business hours'), during
			the school year, and during weekdays, while texts and facebook messages would texts
			would be exchanged mainly during 'non-business' hours. </p>
			<p><b>Messaging Activity by Month: </b>This hypothesis is at least partially supported by the data. For both users,
			there is a definite drops in the number of emails sent during the summer months.
			However, this drop also occurs for iMessage and for facebook messenger, suggesting
			that the temporal patterns of messaging across these platforms isn't
			significantly different. The one exception to this pattern occurs for User 2's
			use of twitter. The number of twitter messages sent peaks during the summer
			months and decreases during the school year, suggesting that the use of this
			platform (which is used primarily for personal/social messaging) is greatest during
			'non-business' months. </p>
			<img src="images/months.png" width="700" alt="Messages by Month">
			<p><b>Messaging Activity by Time: </b>The analysis of messaging behavior by time of day shows the greatest number of messages
			 are exchanged during the afternoon and evening hours. However, this pattern
			 does not differ significantly between platforms, again suggesting that there is not
			 a definite differentiation between 'business hours' for academic (email) messages and
			 'personal/social hours' for personal messaging. Instead, all platforms are used
			 rather consistently (though the different degrees as shown above) throughout the waking
			 hours of the day.

            <h2 class="section-heading" id="content">Direct Messaging Across Platforms: Content Analysis</h2>
            <p><b>Message Length: </b>The analysis conducted above of metadata traces across four direct messaging platforms
            suggest that there are definite differences in the ways in which these platforms
            are being used by digital natives. To explore these differences in more depth,
            I decided also to look at the content of the messages. I first evaluated the average message
            length per platform. For both users, the average message length per email was much greater
            (around 400 words/message) than for any other platform. This is complementary to the
            earlier finding that email conversations are generally shorter than those on other
            platforms, and suggests that rather than many short messages, information is primarily
            exchanged via email through a small number of lengthy messages. The longer length
            of email messages compared to those on platforms like facebook messenger, twitter, and
            iMessage may also owe partly to the differing nature of the messages themselves. Emails
            generally follow a certain format, including the inclusion greetings, signatures, and other formalities
            in addition to the main content, all of which may contribute additional words not seen
            on other platforms. </p>
            <img src="images/message_length.png" width="700" alt="Average Message Length">
            <p><b>Use of Emojis</b> 😀 :To evaluate the formality of the messages exchanged on the different platforms,
            I decided to examine the number of emojis used as a simple heuristic. Emojis(which I
            limited to include the set of 67 core emojis) are generally considered to be
            characteristic of personal/social messaging, used as informal expressions of emotion
            between friends. To quantify the use of emojis, I counted the total number of emojis
            used across all messages per platform and normalized this value
            by the total number of messages sent per platform. The results from User 1
            confirm my hypothesis that fewer emojis are being used in email messages than
            in either facebook messages or texts, perhaps suggesting some level of increased
            formality in email exchanges. The results from User 1 however, are rather different, showing
            nearly equal use of emojis between facebook messages and emails. User 2 also uses
            a greater number of emojis across all platforms(between 7 and 9 for email and facebook)
        	compared to user 1 (1-2.5 emojis). This difference may simply be indicative of User 2's
        	proclivity for extensive emojis use (though this doesn't apply to twitter messages), suggesting
        	that the use of emojis depends more on the tendencies of a particular user than on the messaging
        	platform itself.
            </p>
            <img src="images/emojis.png" width="700" alt="Emojis">
            <p><b>Average Word Length: </b>Another metric by which I decided to evaluate message content is the average word length per
            message. Previous research <a href="https://dl.acm.org/citation.cfm?id=1944577">(Brooke et al., 2010)
            </a> has revealed the correlation between word length and formality in the English language.This
            makes intuitive sense, especially in the context of direct messaging, in which informal
            slang, abbreviations and 'text-language' consisting mainly of short words, abounds. The results
            of this analysis in fact indicate that for both users, the average word length is greater
            for email messages than for messages on any other platform. This suggests that email messages
            may in fact be more formal in content, or at least less inclined to use as many short,
            abbreviated words as other messaging platforms.  </p>
            <img src="images/word_len.png" width="700" alt="Average Word Length">
            <p><b>Most Frequently Used Words: </b>Finally, to look explicitly at the types of language used,
            I found at the most frequently used words on each messaging platform. Many of the most
            frequent words were common across platforms, including words like 'I', 'I'm', 'like',
            'think', 'want', and 'know'. However, some differences are also apparent. On <i>facebook messenger</i>
            (data below shown for User 1), the word 'time', and 'work' appear as
            frequently words not common to other platforms. This may suggest, for instance,
            that facebook messenger is being used to coordinate meetings (i.e. finding a 'time' to 'work' on a project)
            amongst groups, a common practice in my personal experience. For <i>email</i>, the most frequent words
            are variants of the words 'google', 'group', and 'wellesley','edu'(data below shown for
            User 1). As the email inbox analyzed is a
            Wellesley inbox, and because many messages are those received through google groups,
            this is expected. The prevalence of these words also confirms earlier suggestions
            that emails are being used primarily for academic matters. On <i>twitter</i>, the list of most
            frequently used words is comprised in large part of short, informal, abbreviated words like 'u'(you),
            'ur'(your), and 'omg'. The twitter handles (usernames) of the users to which the messages
            were written in response to also make an appearance. The wordclouds below provide a visualization of some
            of the most frequently used words on each platform. </p>

			<img src="images/user2clouds.png" width="700" alt="User 2 Wordcloud">
			<p>
			<b>Topic Modelling</b> I also applied topic modeling to evaluate the types of language used
			across direct messaging platforms. Topic modeling is a probabilistic statistical modeling technique through
			which the 'topics' (which appear as clusters of similar words) can be extracted from a document.
			In this case, I applied topic modeling to the corpus of all messages from each platform, divided into
			5 'topics' with 5 words per topic. The results of this topic modeling displayed below tell a story
			similar to that revealed by word frequency analysis. <i>iMessage</i> topics include clusters of
			potentially academic words like 'know' and 'think', as well as clusters of more informal words like
			'I'm', 'you', and 'okay'. The topics generated for <i>Email</i> messages are distinctly more academic
			in nature, including words like 'publication', 'university', 'physics', 'research', and 'student'.
			As the word frequency analysis above revealed, <i>facebook</i> messages are clustered into topics seemingly
			related to planning such as 'time', and 'meet'. The word 'data' also appears twice, likely in an
			academic context. The topics on <i>twitter</i> in contrast, are less specific, and instead consist of
			general and informal words like 'yeah', yes', and 'I've'. In no cases is it clear that the topic
			model was able to distill the message content into distinct topics. Instead, many words appear across
			multiple clusters or are related to words in other clusters. This is likely a result of the great
			diversity of messages within each of the text corpuses. The text of each platform contains a wide
			variety of conversations on different topics, which can be difficult to condense into 5 most prevalent
			topics. Nevertheless, this analysis provides some insight into the types of words and ideas which recur
			on these different platforms. </p>

            <h2 class="section-heading" id="classifier">Classifying Messages by Platform</h2>

            <p>Based on the results of the analysis presented above, there seem to be distinct
            differences between the content of direct messages on the four platforms
            evaluated. To evaluate how distinctive these text features are between platforms,
            a classifier was trained to predict the source(platform) of a given message. A Naive
            Bayes classifier was trained on the content of individual messages taken from
            three sources (email, facebook, and iMessage) (1208  messages from each), and tested
            on a revered set containing 302 messages from each source. A variety of methods of
            text vectorization were also used.
            <ol>
            <li>In <b>bag-of-words unigram</b> representation, each
            word is tokenized, and the frequency of each word token's occurrence in the document is counted.
            A Naive Bayes classifier trained with this vectorization (produced using  sklean's <code>countVectorizer</code>_
			 produced an average test accuracy of <b>84.6%</b> after 4-fold cross-validation. </li>
            <li>A bag-of-words representation using <b>bi-grams</b> (where each token represents a sequence of
            two words instead of one word, as above) produced an average test accuracy of <b>90.5%</b>
            with 4-fold cross validation.</li>
            <li>A <b>Tf-idf</b> (term-frequency times inverse document frequency) vectorization scheme re-weights the
            text features according to overall frequency in the text corpus. In a large corpus, this
            ensures that rare, informative words are not outweighed by common, frequent words with little meaning. A
            Naive Bayes classifier trained with this vectorization scheme (along with a 4-gram representation,
            chosen for the best test accuracy through hyperparameter tuning) produced an average
            test accuracy of <b>95.8%</b> with 4-fold cross validation.   </li>
            </ol>
			The high test accuracies achieved by the classifier suggest that the text features for messages on each platform
			are in fact very distinctive, and can be used to identify the source of a given message very effectively. Furthermore, this analysis reveals that it is not simply single words, but
			combinations of words (bigrams or 4-grams) which allow the classifier to best identify the source
			of a given message. Thus, it appears that sequences of words in addition to words themselves, are
			also distinctive between messaging platforms. The most informative features used by the classifier
			with each text featurization scheme can be seen in this <a href="Classifier.html">classification notebook</a>.
			The confusion matrices below display the performance of a Naive Bayes classifier trained with each of the
			featurization methods. In all cases, the classifier performs best in correctly identifying facebook
			messages, doing so with an accuracy of between 86% and 100%. More errors are made in the identification
			of text messages and email messages, with between 25 and 55% of text messages incorrectly classified
			as facebook messages, and a significant portion of email messages incorrectly classified as either
			text or facebook messages.

            <h2 class="section-heading" id="conclusions">Conclusions</h2>
            Overall, it appears that direct messaging behavior by digital natives
            varies greatly across commonly-used messaging platforms.These differences
            encompass both variations in general message features such as the number of messages,
            length of messages, and length of conversations, as well as variations in message content,
            as revealed through textual analysis and text-based platform classification.
            These different media platforms thus appear to be filling distinct needs of today's
            digital natives, with email being used as a more formal, academic and
            professional resource, iMessage and twitter being used primarily for informal
            social interaction, and facebook messages lying somewhere at the intersection. Elaboration of this
            work should focus on the acquisition of more data traces from a large sample of users and
            potentially across more media platforms. The sample presented here of two users of very similar demographics
            provides some insight into the basic use of direct messaging platforms, but cannot be
            generalized to the larger population of today's digital natives. It would be incredibly interesting to
            explore whether these findings continue to hold when applied to a large sample of digital natives, or
            whether other features can explain differences in direct messaging use between individuals.
            Understanding the way in which today's rising adults engage in direct messaging is important for
            informing a greater understanding of the ways in which we communicate in the modern world,
            the ways in which these communications can be contextually adapted, and the ways in which
            new forms of media affect our everyday lives.
